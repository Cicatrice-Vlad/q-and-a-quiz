 # TODOS
 - planm and create your array of questions
 - iterate through the array of questions and display the first question
 - display the 4 possible answers for each quesation
 - create a timer (general timer for the entire game NOT for each question)
 - make sure you have logic to know which answer is your correct one
 - on click of the correct answer you want to move onto the next question/answers, and ring the "correct" sound frfom sfx folder (and maybe highlight the correct answer in green?)
 - on click of the wrong answer, decrease the timer value by 5-10 or whatever and DO NOT progress to the next question and ring the "wrong" sound from sfx folder (maybe highlight the clicked answer as RED if it's wrong?)
 - before the quiz starts, collect the name of the user (maybe from an input?)
 - at the end of the quiz associate the rmaining time with the name the user typed in the input at the beginning, and store that in LS (maybe as an object {name: "John", score:"23"})
